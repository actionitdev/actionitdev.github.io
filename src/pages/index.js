                  Action IT is an innovative IT consultancy supporting NGOs with
                  limited resources in delivering sustainable IT projects. We
                  support qualified university student volunteers working on
                  well-defined projects within a professional team. Action IT
                  supports both studentâ€™s professional development and the
                  delivery of projects that would have otherwise been impossible
                  to deliver at third sector organisations.

                  At Action IT we aim to be a transparent and accountable
                  initiative, recognising that our primary responsibility is to
                  both the organisations we work with and the students that work

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  To maintain such accountability, we have a Supervisory Board

                  This team comprises members from across the university and NGO

                  organisations we work with.

                  <br />
                  This team receives a summary report from the Action IT

                  recommendations or suggestions for improvement as appropriate.
