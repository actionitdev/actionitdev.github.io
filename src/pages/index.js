                  Action IT is an innovative IT consultancy supporting NGOs with
                  limited resources in delivering sustainable IT projects. We
                  support qualified university student volunteers working on
                  well-defined projects within a professional team. Action IT
                  supports both studentâ€™s professional development and the
                  delivery of projects that would have otherwise been impossible
                  to deliver at third sector organisations.

              <p>
                Action IT operates "Burst" mode working to ensure the successful
                delivery of infrastructures and solutions. Applicants initially
                join a 10-week Development Burst in either semester 1 or
                semester 2 (teaching week 1 to 10) to intensively work on
                existing, well-scoped projects for NGOs. Projects are signed-off
                and handed over to NGOs at the end of each Development burst
                with documentation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Design and Scoping bursts amid Development bursts, where goals
                are set and prioritized. Major deliverables, project schedules,
                and milestones are defined and project plans are developed. More
                experienced Action IT members will have the chance to contribute
                to the Design and Scoping burst after accomplishing at least two
                Development bursts. Ongoing maintenance and support will be
                performed throughout the bursts.
