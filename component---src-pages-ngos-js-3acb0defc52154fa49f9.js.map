Each Development burst\n            lasts for 10 weeks, which allows Action IT volunteers to work\n            intensively on existing projects for NGOs. Projects are signed-off\n            and handed over to NGOs at the end of each Development burst with\n            detailed documentation.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Due to the nature of the burst mode, all Action IT projects need to\n            be well-scoped to make sure the volunteers can deliver the projects\n            on time with good qualities. Amid Development bursts, Action IT also\n            runs Design and Scoping bursts where goals are set and prioritized.\n            Major deliverables, project schedules, and milestones are defined\n            and project plans are developed. Please get in touch with us if you\n            would like to know how Action IT can help with your organisation and\n            whether your projects will fit our burst mode.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
